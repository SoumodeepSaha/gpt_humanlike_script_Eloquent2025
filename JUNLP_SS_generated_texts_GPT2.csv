 On this particular night, John shifts from business talk to personal reflections, recounting his troubled youth, disillusionment with his father's bank, and his ambitions I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. Can you believe it? 
 He opens up about how these experiences led him to leave the family bank and work for Dawson, influenced by the speculator Sponley. Can you believe it?

"Wow, that’s crazy! Uh, yeah... England offers diverse sea-bathing resorts, with climates ranging from bracingly cold to mild and relaxing, making it ideal for health retreats You know what? Never mind that.. Anyway,  
 Sea-air is especially pure, often rich in ozone, saline particles, and possibly iodine, which contribute to its distinctive smell and health benefits Actually, that’s a good point, but…. 
 It is dense, stable in temperature, and more stimulating than inland air improving appetite and general vitality in visitors Actually, that’s a good point, but…. 
 However, many seaside towns suffer from poor sanitation, including untreated sewage discharged near public beaches, which undermines the benefits of sea-air. I mean, who would’ve thought! 
 When choosing a sea-bathing location, it's vital to check for proper drainage, clean water supply, and good general hygiene, especially for invalids. 
 Timing of sea-bathing varies by region: the east coast is limited to summer months, while some southern resorts offer an extended season from April to November, though peak summer heat can interrupt bathing. Can you believe it? In the north, the best time to visit is from mid-September to December, but the warmer months are typically longer.
The best beaches in the south can be found in midwinter, from late September to mid October. 
Sea-bats are the most common sea mammals on Earth, providing a habitat for many species, particularly sea lions and seals. I mean, who would’ve thought! Sea lions are also known to have been known for their great ability to fly and to swim. They are particularly important for swimming in open waters and are able to use their claws to grasp small prey.

At some beaches it is recommended to set up a spot in a park or on a boat to catch a glimpse of the ocean Actually, that’s a good point, but…. Also, beach-goers should be aware that the water is very warm, so it will be warmer in summer. Wow, that’s crazy! You can also try to stay on the shore and watch the sea, or watch for signs of life You know what? Never mind that.. I mean, who would’ve thought! During the day, make sure that you look out for fish, as they may be attracted to the waters. Wow, that’s crazy!

The Chinese have a naval blockade on the western part of this port, but the city is protected by an iron wall that is reinforced by a series of large gates. In order to prevent the destruction of their city, Chiya, with his wife, makes a daring rescue of an American woman.

"Mordecai, a Jew living in Shushan, had raised his orphaned cousin Hadassah (Esther) as his own daughter after her parents died What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. I mean, who would’ve thought! 
 Esther was taken into the royal palace as part of the king's search for a new queen and placed under the care of Hegai, who favored her and gave her special treatment. 
 Mordecai instructed Esther to keep her Jewish identity secret, and he monitored her well-being daily from outside the women's quarters. 
 All women underwent a year-long purification process before appearing before King Ahasuerus; Esther followed Hegai's advice rather than requesting extras. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 Esther won favor with everyone and, ultimately, the king himself, who chose her as queen, replacing Queen Vashti Actually, that’s a good point, but…. I mean, who would’ve thought! I mean 
 To celebrate, the king held a grand feast in Esther's honor, released provincial tributes, and distributed royal gifts.

Revelations from the Holy Land
A Jewish historian told me that in July 1628, after the death of Esther, her father, King Charles III of France, visited the city of Shiloh and asked his followers to pray for her. I mean, who would’ve thought! He had met with the Jews and their families in exile in France. 
Charles, in turn, wanted to show that the French had a religious and political agenda that was different from what was presented to them by the English.    
He also wanted the return of a portion of his money to the Jewish community You know what? Never mind that.. You won’t believe this... The next year the King issued a decree requiring all Jews to be baptized and to submit to a yearly census You know what? Never mind that.. Can you believe it? After the census, Charles had to pay a fine of 1,000 ducats Actually, that’s a good point, but…. You won’t believe this... I mean, wait, let me think...

Key objectives include: Balanced and sustainable economic and social progress, including the creation of a single market and monetary union with a single currency.

EU citizenship to strengthen rights and protections of member state nationals What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. seriously Enhanced cooperation in justice and home affairs I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. The Union must respect the 'acquis communautaire' (the body of existing EU law) and assess further integration as needed, while adhering to subsidiarity (making decisions at the most local effective level). Can you believe it? A single institutional framework ensures consistent action across all EU activities, particularly in foreign, security, economic, and development policies You know what? Never mind that.. I mean, who would’ve thought! Honestly, I'm not so sure. The European Council comprising heads of state/government and EU leadership guides political direction and reports progress to the European Parliament.

 Stone reflects on his growing distrust of military bio-weapons programs, especially after prior unethical developments, and holds deep cynicism toward figures like General Starkey You know what? Never mind that.. Can you believe it? 
 Project: Blue is a newly engineered virus, combining influenza and HIV, designed to evade immune responses by mutating in reaction to the body's defenses You know what? Never mind that.. 
 The virus is airborne, highly lethal, and immune to standard containment; it leads to death by mucous-induced suffocation and physical collapse. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 Stone realizes that Blue is a true Doomsday virus, capable of annihilating populations indiscriminately making it a catastrophic weapon with global consequences.

"Wow, that’s crazy! Dr. Orion Hood, a renowned criminologist and moral disorder specialist, lives and works in a meticulously ordered suite of rooms overlooking the North Sea in Scarborough. 
 His consulting rooms reflect aesthetic control and precision, where even luxury and poetry (like cigars, spirits, and poetry books) are displayed with strict order and restraint I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. You won’t believe this... so 
 The environment suggests a scientific, almost ritualistic reverence for knowledge, discipline, and cleanliness mirroring the orderly, monotonous sea outside. I mean, who would’ve thought! 
 Dr. Hood himself is controlled yet energetic, embodying the same paradox of rigidity and restlessness present in his surroundings I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. Well, you see... 
 Into this sterile and elegant world comes a startling contrast: a small, disheveled, and awkward figure, likely a Catholic priest, with a worn umbrella and oversized clerical hat I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. I mean, who would’ve thought! 
 The newcomer's shabby and unassuming presence starkly contrasts the environment and Dr. Hood's character, setting up a clash of worlds or ideologies.

Dr, Hood is the first to be identified as a ""doctor.""  The name suggests he is not a doctor at all, but rather an associate professor at a top university with extensive experience in the field of psychiatry. He is a professional therapist, the only member of his class who is able to speak his mind Actually, that’s a good point, but…. Wow, that’s crazy!

"I mean, who would’ve thought! Finnish language and culture are deeply intertwined with nature, with precise and acoustically rich verbs used to describe natural elements like snow, wind, and animals I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. 
 Ancient Finns practiced animistic nature-worship, viewing all visible forces sun, moon, sea, earth as living, conscious beings. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 Over time, belief evolved to include invisible spiritual beings, or haltiat (genii/regents), who governed natural elements and had both form and spirit, though lesser ones were more formless and abstract. 
 These haltiat were immortal and hierarchical, often ranked based on the significance of their domain (e.g., Tapio of the forest outranking Pilajatar, daughter of the aspen) You know what? Never mind that.. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 Finnish mythology emphasizes the independence and dignity of each deity, regardless of power; even a minor god rules absolutely within their sphere Actually, that’s a good point, but…. You won’t believe this... 
 Deities were typically paired and familial, with the sky and celestial bodies being the earliest and most revered objects of worship, leading to the concept of Jumala, the thunder-home, as the supreme god.

Folklore and Literature
 I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. Honestly, I'm not so sure. The Finnish folk tales are frequently written in the languages of medieval Europe, but they were usually written from the early 15th century onward, beginning with a number of traditional Finnish sagas, such as Köln's Kultur, which was written by the Finnish poet, Aarghalas. A collection of these works, titled Känninen Kautinen (The Tales of Kootenai), was published in 1623 in Finland, in a series of poems, called Kollai, written to commemorate the birth of a new deity You know what? Never mind that.. In his own words: ""I am the son of an old man and I am of great renown, I will conquer the world and bring about the end of all things.""
, published by A. N. Kauni in 1715 You know what? Never mind that.. Can you believe it? This collection was edited into a compilation of poetry, entitled Koolai You know what? Never mind that.. As Kulehilä, Kustilin, is a Finnish word meaning ""wisdom"" or ""the power of wisdom,"" the collection has a similar quality to a ""Kulehi"" poem, although the poems are in some ways more poetic than the Künkei poems. It is possible that these poems were written for an audience of young children, to be read by children in school, for the purpose of stimulating their imagination, Actually, that’s a good point, but…."

 Second gripe: Future Work sections: These are seen as either unnecessary, self-centered, or misleading, implying the work is incomplete or simply listing personal intentions. Wow, that’s crazy!

 Although it's midwinter, geraniums and violets (Blue Czar variety) bloom abundantly in the sandy soil, adding color to the garden Actually, that’s a good point, but…. You won’t believe this... 
 The garden features a diverse mix of trees and plants from various climates, including fruit trees like fig, peach, apple, and almond, as well as bananas, willows, and oaks Actually, that’s a good point, but…. 
 There are no raspberries or currants, but large strawberry beds and endless grapevines stretch across the property, offering promise for summer abundance I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. 
 Clumps of bamboo, pampas grass, and New Zealand flax add exotic charm; the writer expresses great contentment with the new home despite being too tired for walks around Perth just yet.

The house is very popular with young couples who want to stay in for a year Actually, that’s a good point, but…. If you can't afford a small room in Perth, you might consider buying a room on the side of the road instead What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. You won’t believe this... You can get a good view of Perth from the back entrance of an old house on a ridge above the river. Could be wrong, but... The house has two bedrooms, one on either side. As with many small houses, the owner has plenty of space to accommodate a couple of small children. I'd recommend you get the house if you're planning on moving up the ladder or if there are any issues with your current home.!"
"Oh, actually... Language models are statistical systems that learn probability distributions over language by analyzing large samples of linguistic data, aiming to represent human language patterns. 
 Creating high-quality models depends heavily on sufficient, diverse, and well-curated training data, as well as strong computational and design frameworks. I mean, who would’ve thought! 
 Modern generative language models predict the most plausible next sequence based on preceding context; how context is incorporated is still an active research area. 
 These models are not true communicative agents but tools for language generation, whose outputs can be fine-tuned and aligned using task-specific data and human feedback to better fit certain purposes or voices. Could be wrong, but... 
 Fine-tuning introduces normative and cultural constraints, meaning model behavior is shaped by human values, judgments, and expectations not neutral or universal I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. You won’t believe this... 
 Despite their fluency, language models do not possess understanding or truth-tracking ability; they generate plausible strings based on probability, and terms like truthful or hallucinated are misapplied, as all outputs are fundamentally ungrounded in external reality.

In fact, many linguists think that the best way to learn a language is to read it. You won’t believe this... seriously In a world where information is increasingly limited by the number of different ways in which it can affect human thought and behavior, the problem of how to train a model for the task of learning a new language needs to be addressed. 
For a practical approach to language learning, we need to start with a basic understanding of what we are learning. Can you believe it? The problem is that we have no idea how many languages are used in the world at the moment Actually, that’s a good point, but…. I think, maybe... We know that in most of the worlds in human history, there have been a few hundred or so languages spoken. I mean, who would’ve thought! As we get older, our knowledge of languages becomes less relevant, so we begin to rely on the knowledge from a relatively small number. This is where the ""measurement problem"" comes into play You know what? Never mind that.. You won’t believe this... I think, maybe...  
It's not a problem we can solve with simple arithmetic, but we could solve it with an understanding that language and people are very different You know what? Never mind that.. To do this, it is necessary to create a framework for learning languages by considering how they can contribute to our understanding. That framework should include a set of tools and concepts, including model learning models and a knowledge base of language learners. These frameworks should be available to all languages, from the more advanced languages like C and C++ to the less advanced ones like Python, Python 3, or even Go.    
The framework could?"
"I mean, who would’ve thought! The speaker expresses deep gratitude and humility upon receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, thanking supporters, family, and teachers for their love, inspiration, and encouragement. Can you believe it? 
 She is proud to be the first Pashtun, the first Pakistani, and the youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate, humorously noting she still quarrels with her brothers Actually, that’s a good point, but…. 
 She shares the honor with Kailash Satyarthi, emphasizing the significance of Indo-Pakistani cooperation in the fight for children's rights I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. 
 Named after Malalai of Maiwand, a heroic Pashtun figure, she embraces the name Malala with joy and dedication to her cause What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. 
 The award is presented as a symbol for all children those who are forgotten, frightened, or voiceless and a call to action, not pity You know what? Never mind that.. 
 She defines herself not just as a survivor of violence, but as someone who fights for the right to education and peace for all children.

She is also known as ""The Mother of Peace"", the last survivor to win the Peace prize. I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.?"
"The text proposes a comparison between Norse and Greek mythologies, calling both grand, but asserting that Norse mythology is the grander of the two Actually, that’s a good point, but…. I mean, who would’ve thought! I'm not sure, but... 
 Both mythologies are credited with profound influence on European civilization, especially in shaping literature, culture, and political identity What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. 
 While Greek mythology has played a more visible role in literature, the author argues that Norse influence is deeper and more enduring, particularly in Northern European, English, and American character. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 The writer predicts a growing scholarly interest in Norse history, religion, and literature, especially in the U.S., which is seen as culturally connected to Norse heritage What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. Uh, yeah... 
 Both mythologies arise from interpreting natural forces as divine, but they differ in how they personify, narrate, and ethically elaborate those natural phenomena. 
 The storytelling traditions of the Greeks, Hindus, and Norse people took a shared core of mythic elements and shaped them into distinct systems reflecting their unique worldviews Actually, that’s a good point, but…. The writers of both myths hope to inspire and shape a new generation of readers, in an effort to understand how the different cultures of different nations and cultures have evolved and adapted to the modern world.

The authors believe that in understanding the power of Norse myths, scholars can learn from the history of Greek and Roman myth and learn to develop new, more critical approaches to understanding their world and history.."
"The normal human body temperature is around 98.6°F and remains remarkably stable regardless of environmental extremes, thanks to internal regulation Actually, that’s a good point, but…. 
 This stability is maintained by the body's ability to balance heat production and heat loss, primarily through metabolic combustion of food and tissue I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. I'm not sure, but... 
 The blood plays a central role in distributing heat, as it fuels combustion in tissues and circulates warmth throughout the body via the heart and blood vessels I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. Oh, actually... 
 Nerve centers in the spinal cord help regulate blood vessel dilation and contraction; damage to these areas can disrupt temperature control and become life-threatening I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. 
 The safe range for body temperature is narrow deviations as small as 7°F above or below normal can be dangerous, and reaching 109°F or 76°F is fatal. I think, maybe... 
 The body loses excess heat through evaporation (lungs and skin), radiation, and conduction, with skin evaporation being a particularly powerful cooling mechanism.

An increase in body heat is a major source of heat transfer from the extremities to the skin You know what? Never mind that.. Can you believe it? This process is called evapsoration What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. Wow, that’s crazy! The skin and other tissues absorb and store heat from external forces, such as the wind, which can then be transferred to tissues through the kidneys You know what? Never mind that.. For this purpose, the human respiratory system is also responsible for heat release from skin, kidneys, lungs, blood, hair, nails, etc Actually, that’s a good point, but…. You won’t believe this... It is the main source and source for many diseases and conditions You know what? Never mind that.. .
, a body-surface temperature increase that is due to an increase of blood pressure (or higher blood pressures), or an increased concentration of sweat. A body body mass index (BMI) is measured using a thermometer to measure body fat and body density, while a heart rate (HR) measures blood flow through blood-brain barrier (BBB).
- A person's body weight is determined by their body composition, body size, height, weight gain, bone density (BMD), and height Actually, that’s a good point, but…. Can you believe it? As a result, people with normal body proportions tend to be thinner and lighter than people without any of these characteristics.!"
"The subject sleeps late, often rising just before noon and moving between his bedroom and an attic sitting-room, wearing a dressing gown. 
 Over time, his sitting-room transforms into a richly personal space filled with artwork, books, and personal effects, reflecting his inner life and changing moods What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. 
 The walls are decorated with a rotating selection of photographs, paintings, and cutouts, including landscapes, portraits (possibly of a young woman he knew), and spiritual figures like Buddha and Gandhi. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 The room is overflowing with books, many of them poetry and philosophy, with well-worn volumes of Goethe, Jean Paul, Novalis, and Dostoievski, marked with notes and slips of paper. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 He surrounds himself with signs of intellectual and artistic activity, including a paint box, flowers, wine bottles, and cigar ash a blend of inspiration and decadence. 
 His sitting-room becomes a symbol of his solitary, reflective lifestyle, suggesting both learned retreat and personal disarray, infused with smoke, wine, and literature.

He is also a frequent visitor to the New York City Museum of Modern Art, where he has been exhibiting for more than a decade. I mean, who would’ve thought! Well, you see... He has also been an avid student of French history and the French Revolution.

"Free trade refers to international trade without restrictions like tariffs, quotas, or subsidies; it aligns with free market principles and is typically favored by economically liberal political parties. 
 While most countries support free trade through organizations like the WTO, many still implement protectionist policies to support local industries and jobs. Can you believe it? 
 Historically, trade openness has fluctuated, expanding in the 19th century, collapsing during the Great Depression, and rising again post-1950s now reaching historically high levels Actually, that’s a good point, but…. 
 Economists largely agree that free trade promotes economic growth, though it can also lead to unevenly distributed losses and job displacement in certain sectors. Can you believe it? 
 Benefits of free trade include barrier-free trade in goods and services, open market access, and undistorted competition with theoretical support from concepts like comparative advantage What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. 
 Some economists like Ha-Joon Chang argue that developing nations may need protectionist policies to compete globally, while critics believe they benefit from access to technology and richer markets.

Some argue there is a need for greater openness in these areas, such as the free movement of goods, which is critical for economic development I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. I mean, who would’ve thought! I'm not sure, but... This is partly due to free-trade agreements like NAFTA and the GATT, but also because they promote economic freedom, especially in Africa, where the African Union (AU) has long been viewed as an equal partner. like As an example, the United States has recently been considering a free pass on trade to the EU and other developing countries. actually (For more, see the article ""Free Trade Talks: A Global Trade Model."")

"You won’t believe this... Saffron is a spice derived from the dried stigmas of the Crocus sativus flower, prized for its distinct flavor, fragrance, and golden color, and is the most expensive spice by weight. 
 It likely originated in Iran, though Greece and Mesopotamia are also possible origins. It is a sterile, triploid plant that must be manually propagated via corms, as it produces no viable seeds Actually, that’s a good point, but…. You won’t believe this... 
 The spice's flavor and aroma come from picrocrocin and safranal, while its color comes from crocin, a carotenoid pigment I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. 
 The word saffron comes from Arabic and Persian roots, ultimately referring to its golden hue (zarparan = gold strung) I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 Crocus sativus is a domesticated clone believed to descend from C. cartwrightianus, and it slowly spread across Eurasia, North Africa, and beyond through human cultivation What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 The plant features non-photosynthetic cataphylls, long green blade-like leaves, and underground corms, which are seasonally divided and replanted to propagate new growth.

Crocus is native to Central Asia, the Middle East, Central and South America, Africa and Southeast Asia.!"
