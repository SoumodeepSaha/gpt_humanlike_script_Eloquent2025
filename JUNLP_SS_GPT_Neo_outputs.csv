"Honestly, I'm not so sure. The letter is from someone claiming to be Prince Joe Eboh, Chairman of the Contract Award Committee of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). 
 The sender explains that a surplus of $25 million USD from petroleum contracts needs to be discreetly transferred out of Nigeria. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 Due to local laws prohibiting civil servants from holding foreign accounts, they seek a foreign partner to temporarily receive the funds. 
 The recipient is promised 20% of the amount for their cooperation, while 75% will go to committee members and 5% for expenses. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 The sender requests personal and banking details from the recipient to initiate the transfer. 
 The letter emphasizes secrecy and urgency, aiming to complete the transaction in 21 working days.

The recipient has responded by saying that they will only be able to receive $8 million, and they are willing to pay $5 million as a deposit to avoid any complications. They are also willing, for a fee of 3% per month, to arrange a loan to cover the remaining balance. Wow, that’s crazy! The payment will be due on the 1st of August. A payment schedule is attached.

"so The email is from someone claiming to be Barrister Martins Jide, attorney to a deceased Japanese engineer, Engr. Suk Hun Wufei Flody, who allegedly worked with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). I mean, who would’ve thought! 
 The engineer and his family reportedly died in a house explosion in August 2003, leaving behind $9.3 million USD in a Ghanaian bank account. 
 The attorney claims he cannot find any legitimate next of kin and is seeking the recipient's help to pose as a relative to claim the funds. 
 The proposed split of the money is 55% for the attorney, 40% for the recipient, and 5% for expenses and taxes You know what? Never mind that.. 
 The email emphasizes secrecy, legality, and trust, promising that all legal documents are in place to support the claim I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. 
 The sender asks for the recipient's phone and fax numbers to proceed with the arrangement.

The sender's email address is ryan@rp-lawyers.com. You won’t believe this... The recipient is identified as ""Mr. J What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. Lee, Attorney at Law"", and the email appears to have been sent by Lee's firm, Rp Law Firm, PLLC. A copy of Lee’s firm's website is included. You won’t believe this... According to the website, Lee is a graduate of Columbia University, where he received a B.A. Wow, that’s crazy! in Political Science. I think, maybe... He went on to receive an M.S. seriously and Ph.D. actually from the University of Chicago. Prior to his employment with R.P Actually, that’s a good point, but…. Law, he worked as an attorney for more than 20 years at a law firm in Chicago, Illinois. You won’t believe this... His current practice focuses on civil litigation, personal injury, real estate, business and criminal litigation. In addition to Lee and Rpp, the sender lists a number of other attorneys, including the lawyer who represented the NNPC engineer in his civil suit against the company, as well as attorneys representing the deceased engineer‟s family. One of these attorneys is Lee himself You know what? Never mind that.. At the bottom of each email, there is an attachment that appears either to contain a document or to simply contain the name of a company. I mean, who would’ve thought! There are also a series of links to documents hosted on a website associated with Lee. You won’t believe this... These links take users to various web pages. Among these pages is one that contains a web page for a lawyer named “Robert Lee of RPP Law” I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. I mean, wait, let me think...

"Well, you see... In John Bagsbury's modest home library, he and Dick Haselridge are having a deep, late-night conversation, while his wife Alice and daughter Martha have gone to bed. 
 Their discussions are often centered around John's business, which Dick genuinely enjoys and understands with intellectual interest What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. Can you believe it? 
 On this particular night, John shifts from business talk to personal reflections, recounting his troubled youth, disillusionment with his father's bank, and his ambitions. You won’t believe this... 
 He opens up about how these experiences led him to leave the family bank and work for Dawson, influenced by the speculator Sponley. 
 Dick listens closely, hiding her dislike for Sponley, and shows empathy when John speaks of leaving his father, calling it a terrible disappointment to grandfather Actually, that’s a good point, but…. 
 The scene reveals a growing emotional intimacy and mutual respect between John and Dick, layered beneath the business talk.

 The film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, who had been impressed by Bigsbury and Hassellridge's work.

 Production  The B-movie adaptation of this story is considered a work of fiction, but Hitchcock did not have a role in the film. I mean, who would’ve thought! The title of the movie is a pseudonym for Hitchcock's character, Babs. I mean, who would’ve thought! Hitchcock had never heard of Bogsbury, or Bagged, before his casting. He had read a short story about the bank he worked for, so he decided to adapt the story Actually, that’s a good point, but…!"
"Can you believe it? England offers diverse sea-bathing resorts, with climates ranging from bracingly cold to mild and relaxing, making it ideal for health retreats. You won’t believe this... 
 Sea-air is especially pure, often rich in ozone, saline particles, and possibly iodine, which contribute to its distinctive smell and health benefits. 
 It is dense, stable in temperature, and more stimulating than inland air improving appetite and general vitality in visitors. 
 However, many seaside towns suffer from poor sanitation, including untreated sewage discharged near public beaches, which undermines the benefits of sea-air Actually, that’s a good point, but…. 
 When choosing a sea-bathing location, it's vital to check for proper drainage, clean water supply, and good general hygiene, especially for invalids. 
 Timing of sea-bathing varies by region: the east coast is limited to summer months, while some southern resorts offer an extended season from April to November, though peak summer heat can interrupt bathing.

The most popular seasides are those along the coast, particularly those in the south, such as the French Riviera and the Mediterranean, where beaches are sandy and warm, but the water is often polluted Actually, that’s a good point, but…. Well, you see... The west coast offers warmer water and less pollution. Inland, there are many towns and resorts with sandy beaches and water that is clean, fresh and pleasant, like the coasts of the UK and Ireland. This is a popular area for families and those seeking a holiday with a mixture of relaxing beaches What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. I mean, who would’ve thought! There are also many resorts in mountainous areas such the Alps, the Karakoram, Himalaya and Himalayas, as well as many other resorts on the Atlantic coast. You won’t believe this... Other popular beaches include the South Coast, New England and Southern France. Many of these resorts are popular with people travelling for the beach, or for other reasons Actually, that’s a good point, but…. Others are tourist resorts that are part of a chain. Wow, that’s crazy! For example, in North America, a number of resorts such a St. Can you believe it? Augustine Beach are connected by the St Augustine Inlet. Oh, actually... Another example is the resorts of Cancun, Mexico. Some of them are linked by other attractions. These resorts often have a variety of water sports, restaurants, bars, hotels, shops and golf courses. I mean, who would’ve thought! They also have water parks and spas. One of those is at the Cenote del Cuyo in Cascada, Costa Rica What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. Wow, that’s crazy! It has water from the lake at an altitude of up to  and has a temperature of , which is ideal. Also, some resorts have Actually, that’s a good point, but…!"

 After passing through the Bitter Lakes, the ship enters the Red Sea, where the heat becomes increasingly oppressive, especially for the crew working below deck I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. Oh, actually... 
 Conditions become so severe that the ship must be periodically turned to cool the stokeholds and engine-rooms with headwinds. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 A rumor of a German ship coaling at Jeddah prompts an investigative stop; Turkish officials deny the claim with superficial courtesy. You won’t believe this... 
 In Aden, the narrator takes a brief excursion to see the ancient water Tanks, marveling at their design and the transition to modern water distillation. 
 A local Arab boy, fluent in French but with limited English, offers to guide them, amusingly repeating a line asking for backsheesh.

The narrative is told in the third person by the captain, who is a retired British naval officer, and a young Turkish officer What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. I mean, who would’ve thought! The narrative follows the plot of an original novel, The Red Cross (1899), by W.T. Stead, which the young officer had read in English You know what? Never mind that.. You won’t believe this... After the novel was published, Stead's agent, C.M. Edmonds, sent the original manuscript to the British author of The Secret Agent, Sir Walter Scott, to be translated into English for publication. You won’t believe this... However, Scott's editor rejected the manuscript, as he felt that Stead was an unreliable narrator. I mean, who would’ve thought! Thus, he did not publish The Shadow of the Gun, but instead published a second novel in his own name, Captain Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1901).

 We have got a few days before we sail,
 And I shall be sorry to leave this pleasant spot, for I am very anxious to get to sea again. Wow, that’s crazy! . .
 It is very hot, very uncomfortable, here in this place I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. I mean, who would’ve thought! We are very comfortable, I assure you, with a good fire in our stoves and plenty of water. It’s very pleasant, too, when the sun shines, except that it never shines this time of year. I mean, who would’ve thought! I don‘t know what it is, or where it comes from, that makes it so hot. Perhaps the wind. You won’t believe this... There is no wind, at all, now. But the air is so still that one feels the coolness of it. I mean, who would’ve thought! What a pity. You won’t believe this... Then there is the sea!"

  Cigarette Smoking News: an online magazine dedicated to the cigar and cigarette industries. I'm not sure, but... A monthly magazine, Cigarettes and Cigaro, is published in the US, featuring articles and news about the industry. Honestly, I'm not so sure. Cigaretalk.org is a website for cigar enthusiasts. It was created in 1999 by a group of cigar aficionados who wanted to create a site that would be more than just a listing of cigars Actually, that’s a good point, but…. The site was sold to Cigara, a US-based company, in 2001. Wow, that’s crazy! In 2003 Cigaron's parent company was purchased by Philip Morris. Can you believe it? Philip Morissons Cigaranews.ca website was shut down in October 2006 and the website's archives were removed in 2008.

 Cigarreality: a bi-monthly magazine published by Cigarettracy.net. Can you believe it?

 Authors should highlight one key idea rather than trying to compress the full content of their paper into a short talk, especially to avoid information overload. You won’t believe this... 
 Presenters are urged to speak rather than read, minimize use of slides/visuals, and adjust for a diverse, international audience, particularly in terms of language and pacing. Can you believe it? 
 Discourage lectures and long monologues; moderators should facilitate interaction by prompting questions, slowing fast speakers, and interrupting unclear or overly technical jargon. 
 Avoid use of acronyms or informal names (e.g., Bill) speakers should use full names for clarity, with no titles, regardless of home-country custom. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 Strict timekeeping is essential: sessions must end on time, with no leeway in transition periods. I mean, who would’ve thought! Further discussion is encouraged informally after sessions.

"Mordecai, a Jew living in Shushan, had raised his orphaned cousin Hadassah (Esther) as his own daughter after her parents died Actually, that’s a good point, but…. I mean, who would’ve thought! 
 Esther was taken into the royal palace as part of the king's search for a new queen and placed under the care of Hegai, who favored her and gave her special treatment. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 Mordecai instructed Esther to keep her Jewish identity secret, and he monitored her well-being daily from outside the women's quarters. Can you believe it? 
 All women underwent a year-long purification process before appearing before King Ahasuerus; Esther followed Hegai's advice rather than requesting extras. You won’t believe this... 
 Esther won favor with everyone and, ultimately, the king himself, who chose her as queen, replacing Queen Vashti. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 To celebrate, the king held a grand feast in Esther's honor, released provincial tributes, and distributed royal gifts.

Background
In 605, King Xerxes I of Persia had issued a decree decreeing that all Jews must convert to Islam in order to be safe in Persia. The decree was made in response to the persecution of Jews in Babylon I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. You won’t believe this... King Darius I, however, ordered that Jews who converted would be exempt from the death penalty. As a result, many Jews converted to Christianity. Mordechai was one of those converted, but his conversion did not alter his status as a Jewish man I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. I mean, who would’ve thought! When he married Esther, he was given a choice to convert or not. I think, maybe... After being converted and married, Mordekhai gave up his Jewish faith and became a Christian. Esther became the first Jewish queen in the history of Persian-ruled Israel What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. I think, maybe... Her name was changed to Esther. You won’t believe this... She became known as Esther the Jew. In 612, Esther gave birth to a son named Morda. Wow, that’s crazy! For the next few years, she was a widow, raising her daughter Esther and her son Mordai. On the advice of her guardian, Hegemaim, Queen Esther kept her identity a secret. However, as the years went by, it was discovered that Esther had been living a double life You know what? Never mind that.. This was due to Mordakai being in love with her, with the result that Mordokai did nothing to protect Esther from Mordakhai who was jealous of Esther because he had no children of his to provide for her Actually, that’s a good point, but…. Wow, that’s crazy! By the time Mordaki was killed, his wife was pregnant and the son of Mordakia was born, whom Mordiakai named."
"Can you believe it? The Treaty formally establishes the European Union (EU), aiming for closer unity among European peoples, with decision-making brought nearer to the citizen. 
 The Union is built upon the existing European Communities, supplemented by new policies and cooperative frameworks to foster consistency and solidarity What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. I mean, who would’ve thought! 
 Key objectives include: 
 Balanced and sustainable economic and social progress, including the creation of a single market and monetary union with a single currency. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 A common foreign and security policy, potentially leading to a shared defense. 
 EU citizenship to strengthen rights and protections of member state nationals. 
 Enhanced cooperation in justice and home affairs I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. um 
 The Union must respect the 'acquis communautaire' (the body of existing EU law) and assess further integration as needed, while adhering to subsidiarity (making decisions at the most local effective level). You won’t believe this... 
 A single institutional framework ensures consistent action across all EU activities, particularly in foreign, security, economic, and development policies. You won’t believe this... 
 The European Council comprising heads of state/government and EU leadership guides political direction and reports progress to the European Parliament. I mean, who would’ve thought! Legislative and judicial powers remain with the Parliament, Council, Commission, and Court of Justice as laid out in this and previous treaties.

History
The treaty was negotiated by the EU's 27 member states. It was signed on 13 May 2009 by Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the Commission and José Manuel Barroso, the President-in-Office of Council You know what? Never mind that.. The treaty will be signed by all 28 member countries, except the United Kingdom, Ireland, Greece, Malta and the Isle of Man, which have already ratified it. As a result, there are now 31 EU member-states, rather than 27 Actually, that’s a good point, but…. All 28 countries except France have signed the treaty Actually, that’s a good point, but…. I mean, who would’ve thought! In June 2014, a new Treaty of Lisbon was approved by a majority of EU countries. This Treaty is to be ratified by each EU country. Wow, that’s crazy! Although the new treaty does not contain a similar provision regarding the Court, it does provide for the independence of that court and its role as a co-equal part of European judicial and policy-setting bodies. On 5 December 2014 the Council of Ministers approved a protocol on the future role of Parliament and Council in the Union Actually, that’s a good point, but…. Wow, that’s crazy! However, this is still subject to ratification by national parliaments.

  The text of this treaty is identical to that of Article 27 of its predecessor treaty, but with an additional Article 1, stating that: ""The Union shall,!"
"Dr Actually, that’s a good point, but…. Could be wrong, but... Jeremy Stone, though retired from UC-Berkeley, still led the Wildfire Lab's Crises Team, though its funding and activity had dwindled since the last major biological incident in 1977. 
 He is unexpectedly summoned by the military and handed a Top Secret file labeled Project: Blue, signaling the emergence of a new biological threat. 
 Stone reflects on his growing distrust of military bio-weapons programs, especially after prior unethical developments, and holds deep cynicism toward figures like General Starkey. 
 Project: Blue is a newly engineered virus, combining influenza and HIV, designed to evade immune responses by mutating in reaction to the body's defenses What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. 
 The virus is airborne, highly lethal, and immune to standard containment; it leads to death by mucous-induced suffocation and physical collapse. so 
 Stone realizes that Blue is a true Doomsday virus, capable of annihilating populations indiscriminately making it a catastrophic weapon with global consequences.

Awards and recognition
The Crisies, a group of scientists and security professionals who helped uncover the Blue virus and its effects, have been awarded the highest honor of the California Institute of Technology: the ""California Institute Science Award.""   This award is given for outstanding contributions in the field of science, engineering, or technology. The Crisie Award was given to Dr You know what? Never mind that.. I mean, who would’ve thought!

Wow, that’s crazy! He has been an elected Fellow of both the National Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society of London. His work has also been recognized with a number of awards including the Distinguished Scientist Medal from IEEE, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship, an Emmy Award, two NASA Distinguishments, NASA's Presidential Medal of Freedom, National Medal, Outstander Award (the first American awarded for excellence in science), and a National Science Board Presidential Award. you know On July 8, 2008, Dr Stone received the Presidential Distinction Award for Outreach by President Bush.

"basically Dr. Wow, that’s crazy! Orion Hood, a renowned criminologist and moral disorder specialist, lives and works in a meticulously ordered suite of rooms overlooking the North Sea in Scarborough. I mean, who would’ve thought! 
 His consulting rooms reflect aesthetic control and precision, where even luxury and poetry (like cigars, spirits, and poetry books) are displayed with strict order and restraint. I mean, who would’ve thought! 
 The environment suggests a scientific, almost ritualistic reverence for knowledge, discipline, and cleanliness mirroring the orderly, monotonous sea outside. Honestly, I'm not so sure. 
 Dr. Can you believe it? Hood himself is controlled yet energetic, embodying the same paradox of rigidity and restlessness present in his surroundings. 
 Into this sterile and elegant world comes a startling contrast: a small, disheveled, and awkward figure, likely a Catholic priest, with a worn umbrella and oversized clerical hat You know what? Never mind that.. 
 The newcomer's shabby and unassuming presence starkly contrasts the environment and Dr. Hood's character, setting up a clash of worlds or ideologies.

"like Finnish language and culture are deeply intertwined with nature, with precise and acoustically rich verbs used to describe natural elements like snow, wind, and animals. 
 Ancient Finns practiced animistic nature-worship, viewing all visible forces sun, moon, sea, earth as living, conscious beings Actually, that’s a good point, but…. I'm not sure, but... 
 Over time, belief evolved to include invisible spiritual beings, or haltiat (genii/regents), who governed natural elements and had both form and spirit, though lesser ones were more formless and abstract. 
 These haltiat were immortal and hierarchical, often ranked based on the significance of their domain (e.g., Tapio of the forest outranking Pilajatar, daughter of the aspen). 
 Finnish mythology emphasizes the independence and dignity of each deity, regardless of power; even a minor god rules absolutely within their sphere Actually, that’s a good point, but…. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 Deities were typically paired and familial, with the sky and celestial bodies being the earliest and most revered objects of worship, leading to the concept of Jumala, the thunder-home, as the supreme god.
 In the later Middle Ages, a new, more secular religion was introduced, based primarily on Protestant Christianity, in which the gods were regarded as benevolent and benevolent figures who had the power to bestow good or evil on human beings; this was the dominant religion of Finland during the 16th and 17th centuries, until it was largely supplanted by Lutheranism, which stressed the importance of individual salvation.

 Finnish folk poetry is rich with natural imagery, including images of nature and animal life, many of which were used as metaphors in the early Finnish literature. Honestly, I'm not so sure. Finnish poetry can be divided into three broad categories: the epic, lyric, heroic, religious. Wow, that’s crazy! The epic is a long poem about the adventures of heroes, kings, gods, heroes' wives, etc., while the lyric is short and usually focused on a particular subject. Wow, that’s crazy! There are also many folk songs, songs about everyday life and everyday events. Examples include the songs of Mäntysaari, Kalevala, Heikki, Haavisto, Väinämöinen, Tauno and Jukka Actually, that’s a good point, but…. In addition to these epic and lyric forms, there are several other poetic genres, such as epic poems, short lyric poems and short poems What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. These are often called folk song You know what? Never mind that.. Many of these are based in reality, but are not in themselves folk works. For example, Läh What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.?"

"I mean, wait, let me think... The author shares three recurring frustrations when reviewing papers for conferences in applied language technology. you know 
 First gripe: This paper is organised as follows&: The author criticizes this section as a needless waste of space, arguing that a well-structured paper should make its structure clear through content, not formulaic signposting. 
 Second gripe: Future Work sections: These are seen as either unnecessary, self-centered, or misleading, implying the work is incomplete or simply listing personal intentions Actually, that’s a good point, but…. The author suggests a better approach would be to invite collaboration or highlight open questions without staking a claim I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is..

 Third gripe: SAD (Spurious Acronym Disorder): The use of gratuitous acronyms is strongly discouraged, especially in international contexts where they alienate or confuse readers, and create a false impression of complexity or professionalism. 
 Acronyms are deemed unnecessary with modern typing tools, and fully spelled-out terms are more accessible, clear, and inclusive for broader audiences. Can you believe it? 
 The overarching message is a call for clarity, humility, and respect for the reader, rather than rigid adherence to convention or ego-driven signaling.

"Language models are statistical systems that learn probability distributions over language by analyzing large samples of linguistic data, aiming to represent human language patterns I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. 
 Creating high-quality models depends heavily on sufficient, diverse, and well-curated training data, as well as strong computational and design frameworks. You won’t believe this... 
 Modern generative language models predict the most plausible next sequence based on preceding context; how context is incorporated is still an active research area. 
 These models are not true communicative agents but tools for language generation, whose outputs can be fine-tuned and aligned using task-specific data and human feedback to better fit certain purposes or voices. 
 Fine-tuning introduces normative and cultural constraints, meaning model behavior is shaped by human values, judgments, and expectations not neutral or universal. 
 Despite their fluency, language models do not possess understanding or truth-tracking ability; they generate plausible strings based on probability, and terms like truthful or hallucinated are misapplied, as all outputs are fundamentally ungrounded in external reality.

"The text proposes a comparison between Norse and Greek mythologies, calling both grand, but asserting that Norse mythology is the grander of the two. I mean, who would’ve thought! 
 Both mythologies are credited with profound influence on European civilization, especially in shaping literature, culture, and political identity. Well, you see... 
 While Greek mythology has played a more visible role in literature, the author argues that Norse influence is deeper and more enduring, particularly in Northern European, English, and American character. 
 The writer predicts a growing scholarly interest in Norse history, religion, and literature, especially in the U.S., which is seen as culturally connected to Norse heritage. I think, maybe... 
 Both mythologies arise from interpreting natural forces as divine, but they differ in how they personify, narrate, and ethically elaborate those natural phenomena. Can you believe it? 
 The storytelling traditions of the Greeks, Hindus, and Norse people took a shared core of mythic elements and shaped them into distinct systems reflecting their unique worldviews.

Background 

 The author is a professor of medieval history at the University of California, Riverside, where he teaches courses in medieval and early modern history. Uh, yeah... He is also a member of a research team funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities to examine the mythological roots of European and Anglo-Saxon civilization. The team has written a book on the subject of Norse Mythology, which was published in 2011.

 In the introduction, he explains his interest and research in this topic, stating that he has ""been studying the Norse myths for nearly 20 years and can claim to have studied them in depth for over 20,000 years.""
 In his book, The Norse Religion,  the writer states that ""Norse mythology was a powerful force in European culture for thousands of years, from the time of its earliest recorded historical accounts through the late Middle Ages and the early Renaissance."" The book is considered a foundational work in understanding the mythology of Europe Actually, that’s a good point, but…. Wow, that’s crazy! It is often used as a source for historical scholarship. Can you believe it? In contrast, while the Greek myths were more influential in writing literature and culture than the Scandinavian myths, they were not as deeply rooted in ancient European mythology. For example, in The Viking Age, Christopher C Actually, that’s a good point, but…. Smith states: ""The Norse myth is an amalgam of many Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Celtic, Etruscan, Iranian, Indo-European, Hebrew, Greek and Jewish myths. You won’t believe this... All of these myths are intertwined, some more closely than others, all of them."
"The normal human body temperature is around 98.6°F and remains remarkably stable regardless of environmental extremes, thanks to internal regulation What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. 
 This stability is maintained by the body's ability to balance heat production and heat loss, primarily through metabolic combustion of food and tissue. You won’t believe this... 
 The blood plays a central role in distributing heat, as it fuels combustion in tissues and circulates warmth throughout the body via the heart and blood vessels. 
 Nerve centers in the spinal cord help regulate blood vessel dilation and contraction; damage to these areas can disrupt temperature control and become life-threatening. 
 The safe range for body temperature is narrow deviations as small as 7°F above or below normal can be dangerous, and reaching 109°F or 76°F is fatal. 
 The body loses excess heat through evaporation (lungs and skin), radiation, and conduction, with skin evaporation being a particularly powerful cooling mechanism.

The human skin is a highly complex, hydrophobic structure that conducts heat energy through it, which allows it to remain cooler than the surrounding environment Actually, that’s a good point, but…. Can you believe it? However, it is also a source of heat that can transfer to the environment through convection, meaning that skin temperature can rise quickly. This heat is transferred through the skin to a variety of internal organs and tissues, including the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, skin, bones, teeth, muscles, tendons, joints, blood, lymphatic vessels, sweat glands, liver, stomach, intestines, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands and brain What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. I mean, who would’ve thought! The skin has a relatively low heat capacity, so its rate of loss of temperature from the surface of the human being is very small. Heat loss from a surface is much more rapid than that from an internal organ or tissue, but the rate at which heat can move from one area to another is slower You know what? Never mind that.. well In addition, heat transfer through clothing is significantly reduced. I mean, who would’ve thought! These two factors together mean that human beings are very well insulated against the effects of external heat.

 In physiology, the temperature of a body is normally maintained within the range of about 98° to 105° F (37.7°–38° C). I mean, who would’ve thought! The temperature varies greatly depending on the type of environment in which the person lives. For example, a person living in an environment with high humidity may have a higher body core temperature than one living near sea level. It is common for a human to live in a hot environment for the I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.?"
"The subject sleeps late, often rising just before noon and moving between his bedroom and an attic sitting-room, wearing a dressing gown. I mean, who would’ve thought! 
 Over time, his sitting-room transforms into a richly personal space filled with artwork, books, and personal effects, reflecting his inner life and changing moods. 
 The walls are decorated with a rotating selection of photographs, paintings, and cutouts, including landscapes, portraits (possibly of a young woman he knew), and spiritual figures like Buddha and Gandhi You know what? Never mind that.. 
 The room is overflowing with books, many of them poetry and philosophy, with well-worn volumes of Goethe, Jean Paul, Novalis, and Dostoievski, marked with notes and slips of paper. 
 He surrounds himself with signs of intellectual and artistic activity, including a paint box, flowers, wine bottles, and cigar ash a blend of inspiration and decadence. 
 His sitting-room becomes a symbol of his solitary, reflective lifestyle, suggesting both learned retreat and personal disarray, infused with smoke, wine, and literature.

The room's interior design is inspired by the life of the artist, as well as his own inner experience I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. His personal and professional life are juxtaposed in the room, which he calls the ""library of life,"" a metaphor for the state of mind that he seeks to achieve I don't know, it's just... it's just how it is.. actually The title of this book refers to his desire to understand and understand himself, to create and create his life, a life that is ""an open book of secrets.""   The book is not simply a guide to the art of painting, but is also a book about his personal life. It is a record of self-discovery and selfreflection, the quest for self that drives him. A key component of that quest is his self, an exploration of who he is and what he wants to become. Through the book, he hopes to make a change in his thinking, so that his work is more meaningful What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. I mean, who would’ve thought! To that end, this artist has created a series of ""books of books,"" each a different collection of poems and paintings. I mean, who would’ve thought! They are meant to be read together, for example, by a group of students or a family. Each book contains a few poems, artworks, or photographs that are selected by him, then arranged in a sequence of related topics. I mean, who would’ve thought! As an artist himself who has struggled with selfdoubt and doubt in others, these books are intended to provide a personal experience of discovery and transformation."
"I mean, who would’ve thought! Free trade refers to international trade without restrictions like tariffs, quotas, or subsidies; it aligns with free market principles and is typically favored by economically liberal political parties. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 While most countries support free trade through organizations like the WTO, many still implement protectionist policies to support local industries and jobs. Can you believe it? 
 Historically, trade openness has fluctuated, expanding in the 19th century, collapsing during the Great Depression, and rising again post-1950s now reaching historically high levels. 
 Economists largely agree that free trade promotes economic growth, though it can also lead to unevenly distributed losses and job displacement in certain sectors. 
 Benefits of free trade include barrier-free trade in goods and services, open market access, and undistorted competition with theoretical support from concepts like comparative advantage You know what? Never mind that.. 
 Some economists like Ha-Joon Chang argue that developing nations may need protectionist policies to compete globally, while critics believe they benefit from access to technology and richer markets.

Free-trade agreements
The United States and European Union have signed several free-trading agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the World Trade Organization's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The European Free-Trade Association (EFTA) was the first free trading agreement. The United Kingdom, Norway and Iceland are the other members of the EFTA. A few countries are currently negotiating free/open trade agreements with the European Economic Area, the EU, Japan, Canada, Mexico and Australia. Wow, that’s crazy! India and Nepal are negotiating FTAs with Canada and China. Oh, actually... In 2013, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India would consider joining the FTA with Australia and Canada. Oh, actually... According to a 2014 report, Australia is the third largest export market for India. Australia's most recent free and open trade agreement, CETA, was signed in 2013. Ceta includes Australia as a ""non-market economy"" in which Australia will no longer be subject to the Goods and Services Tax What I'm saying is... well, it's complicated.. This is a reversal from Australia’s previous policy of being a market economy, which was a policy that was adopted in 2008 and was replaced by CMAQ in 2010. Well, you see... On July 24, 2014, a memorandum of understanding was reached between the governments of Australia, New Zealand, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Brunei Darussalam, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Malaysia,?"
"Saffron is a spice derived from the dried stigmas of the Crocus sativus flower, prized for its distinct flavor, fragrance, and golden color, and is the most expensive spice by weight. Uh, yeah... 
 It likely originated in Iran, though Greece and Mesopotamia are also possible origins. It is a sterile, triploid plant that must be manually propagated via corms, as it produces no viable seeds. Wow, that’s crazy! 
 The spice's flavor and aroma come from picrocrocin and safranal, while its color comes from crocin, a carotenoid pigment. 
 The word saffron comes from Arabic and Persian roots, ultimately referring to its golden hue (zarparan = gold strung). Wow, that’s crazy! 
 Crocus sativus is a domesticated clone believed to descend from C. cartwrightianus, and it slowly spread across Eurasia, North Africa, and beyond through human cultivation. 
 The plant features non-photosynthetic cataphylls, long green blade-like leaves, and underground corms, which are seasonally divided and replanted to propagate new growth.

Cultivation
The genus Crocuses is named after the genus of plants that was first used to describe the spice, Crocylus, because of its similarity to the flower of that genus. Crocs are native to Eurasian and North African regions. The genus is divided into two groups, the Cucurbitaceae and the Asteraceae. Well, you see... Cauliflowers and chrysanthemums are members of this second group. Both groups are used for the production of sapphires, but the use of these genera as a source of commercial saphire has been discontinued in favor of Crociálaceae, including Cuscuta Actually, that’s a good point, but…. Can you believe it? Some varieties are resistant to drought, making them useful for arid regions, such as the Sahara Desert, where many crops grow poorly. Other varieties, notably the more drought-tolerant varieties of Cicer arietinum, are cultivated for their edible fruits. In addition, saprophytic species of Orobanche and Ephedra have been used in the past Actually, that’s a good point, but…. Can you believe it? This genus also includes some members that are grown for medicinal purposes. I'm not sure, but... Members of genus Euphorbia are known as ""cress-eaters"", and are often cultivated as ornamentals for gardens. I mean, who would’ve thought! They have red and white flowers, although they are not related to."
