The author suggests a better approach would be to invite collaboration or highlight open questions without staking a claim. \n Third gripe: SAD (Spurious Acronym Disorder): The use of gratuitous acronyms is strongly discouraged, especially in international contexts where they alienate or confuse readers, and create a false impression of complexity or professionalism. \n Acronyms are deemed unnecessary with modern typing tools, and fully spelled-out terms are more accessible, clear, and inclusive for broader audiences. \n The overarching message is a call for clarity, humility, and respect for the reader, rather than rigid adherence to convention or ego-driven signaling.",

        "Content": "The normal human body temperature is around 98.6°F and remains remarkably stable regardless of environmental extremes, thanks to internal regulation. \n This stability is maintained by the body's ability to balance heat production and heat loss, primarily through metabolic combustion of food and tissue. \n The blood plays a central role in distributing heat, as it fuels combustion in tissues and circulates warmth throughout the body via the heart and blood vessels. \n Nerve centers in the spinal cord help regulate blood vessel dilation and contraction; damage to these areas can disrupt temperature control and become life-threatening. \n The safe range for body temperature is narrow deviations as small as 7°F above or below normal can be dangerous, and reaching 109°F or 76°F is fatal. \n The body loses excess heat through evaporation (lungs and skin), radiation, and conduction, with skin evaporation being a particularly powerful cooling mechanism.",

        "Content": "Free trade refers to international trade without restrictions like tariffs, quotas, or subsidies; it aligns with free market principles and is typically favored by economically liberal political parties. \n While most countries support free trade through organizations like the WTO, many still implement protectionist policies to support local industries and jobs. \n Historically, trade openness has fluctuated, expanding in the 19th century, collapsing during the Great Depression, and rising again post-1950s now reaching historically high levels. \n Economists largely agree that free trade promotes economic growth, though it can also lead to unevenly distributed losses and job displacement in certain sectors. \n Benefits of free trade include barrier-free trade in goods and services, open market access, and undistorted competition with theoretical support from concepts like comparative advantage. \n Some economists like Ha-Joon Chang argue that developing nations may need protectionist policies to compete globally, while critics believe they benefit from access to technology and richer markets.",

It is a sterile, triploid plant that must be manually propagated via corms, as it produces no viable seeds. \n The spice's flavor and aroma come from picrocrocin and safranal, while its color comes from crocin, a carotenoid pigment. \n The word saffron comes from Arabic and Persian roots, ultimately referring to its golden hue (zarparan = gold strung). \n Crocus sativus is a domesticated clone believed to descend from C. cartwrightianus, and it slowly spread across Eurasia, North Africa, and beyond through human cultivation. \n The plant features non-photosynthetic cataphylls, long green blade-like leaves, and underground corms, which are seasonally divided and replanted to propagate new growth.",
